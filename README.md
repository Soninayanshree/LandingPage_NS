# LandingPage_NS

A simple landing page project (HTML + CSS) for showcasing a design or small product. This repository contains a minimal, static landing page built with plain HTML and CSS.

## What this project contains

- `index.html` — The landing page markup.
- `style.css` — Styles for the landing page (you are currently editing this file).
- `images/` — Folder for images/assets used by the page.

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a small, clean starting point for building and iterating on a static landing page — good for prototyping, demos, and learning CSS layout and responsiveness.

## How to run / preview

Two quick ways to preview the site locally:

1) Open directly in your browser

- Double-click `index.html` or use your editor (right-click → Open in Default Browser).

2) Run a simple local HTTP server (recommended) — useful for relative paths and extensions like service workers

In PowerShell, from the project root (`e:\Integar_Task`):

```powershell
# If you have Python (try py first on Windows):
py -3 -m http.server 8000
# or
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

If you use VS Code, you can also install and use the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".

## Project structure

```

Put any new assets in `images/` and reference them from `index.html`.
